Cost/Funding,Material costs
Cost/Funding,Labor costs
Education,Education and funding for education
Other,Water constraints
Regulatory/Permitting,Lack of coordinated agencies and departments
Time,Transition time to see any profit
Cost/Funding,Lack of incentives to use alternative practices
Cost/Funding,Control of the agricultural industry by large growers and corporations that are focused primarily on the bottom line.
Other,lack of transport for hard to reach places
Other,Inconvenience
Other,Food safety
Cost/Funding,Cost and logistics
Regulatory/Permitting,"Clearance from the County government, permits and charges are just a few hindrances."
Education,The perceived notion that some of these practices are more costly or time consuming; that they will impact yield; or that crops won't meet food safety guidelines.
Other,Access to alternative fertilizers is more difficult to get
Regulatory/Permitting,"Riparian and grassland restoration has barriers due to concerns that native or endangered species that are restored or come back to the land will trigger regulatory requirements for the landowner to protect, which can impact how they can use the land, and trigger other related regulatory costs."
Cost/Funding,Implementation cost and economic evaluation of the biological services they provide
Cost/Funding,"Ultimately, they don't pencil out for producers. Lack of interest. Unproven benefit to operation. Unproven benefit to natural resources."
Regulatory/Permitting,"PERMITTING!!!  By far the number one barrier is the cost, hurdles and general nightmare associated with permits for anything riparian, anything around Oaks as well as the stigma associated with ESHA...The County needs a ""Safe Harbor"" style ordinance. "
Cost/Funding,Funding and resources available for ranchers
Cost/Funding,"(NRCS) Cost of compost, seed, and container plants. Cost and labor of infrastructure to allow long term management such as irrigation, and livestock exclusion (temporary or permanent)."
Education,Lack of education on the benefits of restoring ecosystem services to rangelands.
Cost/Funding,"These are expensive projects that farmers / ranchers do not have the funds to practice even if they want to. Continued funding through the Equip, NRCS, RCD and HSI is necessary. As these projects are completed and successful it is also encouraging for others to see how they work and can be beneficial."
Time,Almost no immediate financial benefit
Cost/Funding,Lack of incentives
Other,"Lack of access to high quality and affordable compost, lack of access to necessary equipment to implement practices"
Education,Stigma/lack of education about practice benefits
Regulatory/Permitting,"County regulations, permitting and costs. There are some wonderful programs available for partnering ranching and rangeland management, but hard to put in place without a lot of red tape."
Cost/Funding,"Access and availability to appropriate native seed/plant stock for restoration can be challenging.  Also, the cost of compost and application for a rangeland setting is cost prohibitive without supplemental funding (i.e. research grants, etc.)."
Education,We need farmer to farmer education where the few farmers who have been implementing alternative practices host field days on their farms.
Other,Water is a major constraint for cover crops and no clear economic advantage has been shown.  In fact it may be a drawback because of the increased frost concerns
Regulatory/Permitting,Need a permit coordination program- something that streamlines permitting of practices that are pre- approved by ALL parties.  The County dragged their feet on this and I believe it never got adopted even though it has been proven very successful in many other counties.
