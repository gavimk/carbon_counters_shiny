barrier,source,stakeholder comment
Cost/Funding,Survey,Material costs
Cost/Funding,Survey,Labor costs
Cost/Funding,Expert,Lack of incentives to use alternative practices
Cost/Funding,Expert,Control of the agricultural industry by large growers and corporations that are focused primarily on the bottom line
Cost/Funding,Survey,Cost and logistics
Cost/Funding,Survey,Implementation cost and economic evaluation of the biological services they provide
Cost/Funding,Expert,"Ultimately, they don't pencil out for producers. Lack of interest. Unproven benefit to operation. Unproven benefit to natural resources."
Cost/Funding,Expert,Funding and resources available for ranchers
Cost/Funding,Survey,"Cost of compost, seed, and container plants. Cost and labor of infrastructure to allow long term management such as irrigation, and livestock exclusion (temporary or permanent)."
Cost/Funding,Survey,"These are expensive projects that farmers and ranchers do not have the funds to practice even if they want to. Continued funding through the Equip, NRCS, RCD and HSI is necessary. As these projects are completed and successful it is also encouraging for others to see how they work and can be beneficial."
Cost/Funding,Expert,Lack of incentives
Cost/Funding,Survey,"Access and availability to appropriate native seed or plant stock for restoration can be challenging. Also, the cost of compost and application for a rangeland setting can be cost prohibitive without supplemental funding (i.e. research grants, etc)."
Education,Survey,Education and funding for education
Education,Survey,The perceived notion that some of these practices are more costly or time consuming; that they will impact yield; or that crops won't meet food safety guidelines.
Education,Survey,Lack of education on the benefits of restoring ecosystem services to rangelands.
Education,Survey,Stigma/lack of education about practice benefits
Education,Survey,We need farmer to farmer education where the few farmers who have been implementing alternative practices host field days on their farms.
Other,Survey,Water constraints
Other,Survey,Lack of transport for hard to reach places
Other,Survey,Inconvenience
Other,Advisory Committee,Food safety
Other,Advisory Committee,Access to alternative fertilizers is more difficult to get
Other,Advisory Committee,"Lack of access to high quality and affordable compost, lack of access to necessary equipment to implement practices"
Other,Advisory Committee,Water is a major constraint for cover crops and no clear economic advantage has been shown. In fact it may be a drawback because of the increase frost concerns.
Regulations/Permitting,Advisory Committee,Lack of coordinated agencies and departments
Regulations/Permitting,Survey,"Clearance from the County government, permits and charges are just a few hindrances."
Regulations/Permitting,Survey,"Riparian and grassland restoration has barriers due to concerns that native or endangered species that are restored or come back to the land will trigger regulatory requirements for the landowner to protect, which can impact how they can use the land, and trigger other related regulatory costs."
Regulations/Permitting,Survey,"PERMITTING! By far the number one barrier is the cost, hurdles and general nightmare associated with permits for anything riparian, anything around Oaks as well as the stigma associated with ESHA...The County needs a ""Safe Harbor"" style ordinance."
Regulations/Permitting,Survey,"County regulations, permitting and costs. There are some wonderful programs available for partnering ranching and rangeland management, but hard to put in place without a lot of red tape."
Regulations,Advisory Committee,Need a permit coordination program - something that streamlines permitting of practices that are preapproved by ALL parties. The County dragged their feet on this and I believe it never got adopted even though it has been proven very successful in many other counties.
Time,Expert,Transition time to see any profit
Time,Expert,Almost no immediate financial benefit
